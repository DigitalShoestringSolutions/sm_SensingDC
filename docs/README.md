# Shoestring Sensing Service Module

This is the Sensing Service Module for the Shoestring ecosystem.  
It runs on a Raspberry Pi. It collects data from locally attached sensors and publishes it over MQTT.  

It is maintained by the [Shoestring](https://digitalshoestring.net/) team.

This module is used by including it in a Shoestring Solution repository. <!--- expand this about procedurally including via Assembler when how to do that is established  -->

This module is configured for the use case by config files written in toml. See the instructions for [Writing a Config File](<./Writing a Config File.MD>)
